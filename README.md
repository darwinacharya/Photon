# Photon
![Photon](https://github.com/photontexteditor/Photon/blob/main/img/photon.jpg)
<p align="justify">"Photon" is a modern text editor with minimalist features using an object-oriented paradigm. It is being developed using the Python programming language and its robust libraries and frameworks. The development process will involve designing an intuitive user interface, integrating advanced text editing and code editing functionalities, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. The anticipated outcome is a sophisticated text editor that empowers users with features such as writing source code for multiple programming languages, copy, cut, find, replace, word count, and user control user interface as basic features.</p>

# Features
Some of the features of Photon Text Editor are:-
1. Basic features include copy, cut, paste, find, and replace functionalities.
2. Intermediate features include word, character, line, and column counters.
3. Advanced features include translation (ne), text-to-speech (en), and various programming languages code editing functionality.
4. Cross-platform availability.
5. Modern Graphical User Interface (GUI).
